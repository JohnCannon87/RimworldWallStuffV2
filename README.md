[h2]Rimworld Wall Defenses V2[/h2]
This mod adds multiple wall mounted items used for defending your colony and is basically an updated version of my original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2401320640]Wall Defenses[/url] mod, YOU CANNOT REPLACE THE ORIGINAL MOD WITH THIS ONE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SAVE !!! (That's why this is a separate mod entirely)

[h1]MULTI ANALYZER DISCLAIMER[/h1]
THIS MOD ADDS A WALL MOUNTED MULTI ANALYZER.
IT IS CURRENTLY (To the best of my knowlege and the Rimworld modding Discord from what I've read) IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE TWO THINGS THAT GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO RESEARCH THINGS THAT NEED A MULTI ANALYZER.
TO SOLVE THIS I HAVE WRITTEN A PATCH THAT WILL OVERWRITE THE NEED TO A VANILLA MULTI ANALYZER WITH THE NEED FOR MY WALL MOUNTED ONE (Honestly if you're not here for things to Wall Mount you're in the wrong mod)
THIS IS CONFIGURABLE IN THE MOD SETTINGS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT !!!

[h2]Changes from the original (Skip if you never used it)[/h2]
[list]
[*]Uses Rimworlds built in wall mounting mechanism where possible (Hence why this isn't save compatible)
[*]Removes Wall Mounted Firefoam Poppers (Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3452778089]Wall Mounted Firefoam[/url] instead it's better than what I had)
[/list]
[*]Removes Wall Mounted Televisions (Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3582096423&searchtext=wall+television]Wall Televisions[/url] instead it's better than what I had) - I patch this to use my extended wall mounting system that needs walls behind all parts of an item not just one cell
[*]Removes Wall Mounted Batteries (Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2514057480]Wallmounted Battery[/url] instead it's better than what I had)
[*]Removes Wall Mounted Switches (Use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3540826161]Wall mounted Switch[/url] instead it's better than what I had)
[*]Removes Wall Replimat (It's now built in yay!)
[*]Simplifed Wall Charger to only have one charger that charges all Mechs, more unbalanced but a lot simpler.

[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
[*]Wall Mounted Blackboard - Works same as Vanilla Blackboard
[*]Wall Mounted Mech Charger (Requires Biotech) - Charges all Mechs and can only store 3 Wastepacks before it needs to be emptied
[*]Wall Mounted HiFi - Provides a small mood boost in a small area
[*]Wall Mounted Neural Supercharger (Requires Ideology) - Will be preferred over any vanilla Supercharger no matter the distance
[*]Wall Mounted Sleep Accelerator (Requires Ideology) - Works same as Vanilla Sleep Accelerator
[*]Wall Mounted Mech Booster (Requires Biotech) - Works same as Vanilla Mech Booster
[*]Wall Mounted Tool Board - Works same as the Vanilla Tool Cabinet, can stack with the Tool Cabinet as well, patches provided for a few different Mods including Vanilla Expanded
[*]Wall Mounted Orbital Trade Beacon - Works same as Vanilla
[*]Wall Mounted Comms Console - Works same as Vanilla, might have some mod incompatabilities depending on how the mod writers handle using the Vanilla Comms Console
[*]Wall Mounted Ground Penetrating Scanner - Works same as Vanilla
[*]Wall Mounted Long Range Mineral Scanner - Works same as Vanilla
[*]Wall Mounted Nano Cloud Dispenser - Repairs all weapons and apparel in a room (On pawns, Shelves and with Odyssey Outfit stands) power and rate of repair can be tuned in mod settings
[*]Wall Mounted Heater, Cooler and Climate Controller - The Heater and Cooler are the same as Vanilla (But the Cooler doesn't need venting) the Climate Controller works as both a Heater and a Cooler for higher build cost, all values for how fast they heat/cool are configurable in mod settings
[*]Wall Mounted Vent - Works same as Vanilla, still uses old mounting system (It has to !)
[*]Wall Mounted Replicator - Can replicate a specific item every configurable time period, this is broken and unbalanced as all hellfire, I will come back to balance this better as I've got some good ideas on how to handle that now
[*]Wall Mounted Multi Analyzer - Works same as Vanilla, please see the HUGE disclaimer above
[/list]


[h3]Mod Compatibility[/h3]
Adds specific items for the following mods:
[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=728314182]RT Fuse[/url] - Adds a Wall Mounted Circuit Breaker that's a bit less effective than RT Fuses built in one
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920385763]Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded[/url] - Adds a Wall Mounted Nutrient Paste Tap that's only 1 cell wide and works the same as the one in this mod
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3530651481]Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded: Reimagined Progression[/url] - Adds Wall Mounted Nutrient Paste Taps for each tier of tap, all only 1 cell wide
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3511009023]Universal Trade Hub (continued)[/url] - Adds a Wall Mounted Trade Hub Terminal
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2785616901]Vanilla Trading Expanded[/url] - Adds a Wall Mounted Trading Terminal
[/list]

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
[list]
[*]The Neural Supercharger doesn't draw a bar for when it's charging, it's surprisingly difficult to get it to offset, the old mod worked because I was building it "inside" the wall so the bar appeared there as well.
[/list]


[h2]The Point Of This Mod[/h2]
When I first created the original Wall Stuff mod not a lot of other things were wall mountable, now that Ludeon have made it MUCH easier to handle (Seriously I've been able to delete so much code) I can clean this mod up, remove some things that other people are doing better than I can (or at least more focused) and I can just fill in the gaps

[h2]Future Plans[/h2]
[list]
[*]Improve performance of the Heater/Cooler/Climate Controller
[*]Balance the Replicator better
